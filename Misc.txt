Using Dynamic Locators instead of Relative xpaths
Goal Statement:1.To reduce the re-work activity in code, we have decided to use â€œDynamic xpathâ€ as locators in Automation code instead of ID. In customized or Dynamic xpath we use the HTML Structural view instead of mentioning a particular ID, hence the absolute HTML structure becomes almost same for all instances if all the fields or UI of the pages are same. 2. Reducing the Testing time Percentage (manual Code changes rework will be decreased by 60-70%, hence testing time will be reduced ). Potential Impact: Dynamic xpath is used to locate exact attribute or decrease the number of matching nodes from a webpage, hence it locates an element in a very unique way. Also, it is very useful when the objects are changing the value of their attributes. So it gives benefits to the tester like 1.The queries become more compact. 2. Syntax can be easy for common cases. 3.Query strings are easily embedded in programs, scripts and XML or HTML attributes. 4.Queries are easily parsed.
